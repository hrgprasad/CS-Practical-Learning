<p>The <span class="serif">City of New York</span> was introduced to professional football on the 
same day that the city was introduced to the <span class="fantasy">New York Giants</span>. It was a clear 
sunny <span class="mono">October afternoon in 1925</span> when the Giants took the field to play against the <span class="cursive">Frankford Yellow Jackets</span>.
